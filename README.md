# cloudopt-next-docker

To facilitate your deployment on Docker based on the development of cloudopt-next, we have created a basic image that is 
easy to use and has been uploaded to Docker Hub, and you only need to be there.
Dockerfile declared in the `FROM cloudopt/cloudopt-next-docker:jdk8` , or ` docker pull cloudopt/cloudopt - next - docker: jdk8 `, at the same time 
We also provide the jdk10 version, which only needs to change the version number jdk8 to jdk10 to enjoy the latest version.

`cloudopt/cloudopt-next-docker:jdk8`
